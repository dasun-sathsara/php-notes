# ModernSite: A Simple PHP MVC Application

This project is a basic note-taking application built with PHP and a rudimentary MVC architecture, inspired by a Laracasts tutorial by Jeffrey Way ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw5ObX8P6as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fw5ObX8P6as)). It serves as a learning exercise to understand fundamental PHP and MVC principles.

#### Key Learnings

-   Server-side scripting with PHP
-   Database interaction with PDO
-   Routing and HTTP request handling
-   Session management
-   MVC architectural pattern
-   Dependency Injection

#### Features

-   **Dependency Injection:** Decouples application components.
-   **Routing:** Directs URLs to controllers.
-   **Database Abstraction:** Simplifies database queries.
-   **Session Management:** Handles user login/logout.
-   **Form Validation:** Basic input sanitation.
-   **MVC:** Organizes code (model layer partially implemented).

#### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure a MySQL database and update `public/index.php`.
3. Execute `php -S localhost:8000` within the project directory.
4. Open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
